# Prerequisites:
- [Docker Desktop](https://www.docker.com/products/docker-desktop/)
- [Airflow](https://airflow.apache.org/docs/apache-airflow/stable/howto/docker-compose/index.html)

Welcome to this repository, where I've embarked on a journey to explore Apache Airflow. To get started, ensure you have Docker Desktop and Airflow installed by following the provided links.

Within this repository, I've crafted a compact yet impactful pipeline designed to orchestrate various tasks seamlessly. Leveraging the power of Airflow running within a Docker container, this experiment reproduces a real-world scenario. At the culmination of the workflow, data is gracefully sent to an S3 bucket.

The data for this experiment is sourced from PokéAPI, and you'll find all the scripts used in this project neatly organized here! Dive in and explore the intricacies of this Airflow experiment.

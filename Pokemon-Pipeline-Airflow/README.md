# Prerequisites:
- [Docker Desktop](https://www.docker.com/products/docker-desktop/)
- [Airflow](https://airflow.apache.org/docs/apache-airflow/stable/howto/docker-compose/index.html)

Welcome to this repository, where I've embarked on a journey to explore Apache Airflow. To get started, ensure you have Docker Desktop and Airflow installed by following the provided links.

Within this repository, I've crafted a compact yet impactful pipeline designed to orchestrate various tasks seamlessly. Leveraging the power of Airflow running within a Docker container, this experiment reproduces a real-world scenario. At the culmination of the workflow, data is gracefully sent to an S3 bucket.

The data for this experiment is sourced from Pok√©API, and you'll find all the scripts used in this project neatly organized here! Dive in and explore the intricacies of this Airflow experiment.
